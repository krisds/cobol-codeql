    <p>
      This metric measures the SEI maintainability index for a compilation unit. The index is designed to give an automated assessment of the maintainability of a piece of software. This calculation is based on existing metrics such as the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead volume. A low value can be used to identify error-prone areas of existing code-bases in order to guide testing and review effort.
