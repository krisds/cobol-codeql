  <overview>
    <p>
      Duplicate procedures with identical or very similar
      contents indicate poorly structured code that is hard to
      maintain. The artificially inflated amount of code hinders
      comprehension, and ranges of similar but subtly different lines
      can mask the real purpose or intention behind the code.
      Duplicate procedures can also suffer from update
      anomalies, where only one of several copies of the code is
      updated to address a defect or add a feature, causing them to
      slowly evolve apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, duplicate procedures can also indicate
      a bug where a procedure was copied with the aim of
      changing it in some way, but the programmer then forgot to
      perform the intended change.

    <p>
      At its simplest, procedure duplication can be
      addressed by removing all but one of the
      duplicate procedures and replacing uses of the
      removed procedures with the (now canonical) single
      remaining definition instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      If two procedures are mostly, but not completely,
      identical, it is often possible to factor out the common
      functionality into a new procedure. This improves
      reusability and resolves the code duplication.
