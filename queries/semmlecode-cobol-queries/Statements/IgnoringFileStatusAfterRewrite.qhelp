<overview>
  <p>
    When a file status field is set for a file, the file status should be checked 
    immediately after any <code>REWRITE</code> statement that uses the file.
    This prevents unexpected errors from breaking the program.
  </p>
</overview>

<recommendation>
  <p>
    Add an <code>IF</code> statement which tests the file status field.
  </p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>
In the following example, the <code>REWRITE</code> statement reads from a file that has a file status field set:
</p>

<sample src="IgnoringFileStatusAfterRewriteBad.CBL" />

<p>
As it stands, whenever this <code>REWRITE</code> statement applies to a file which was not previously opened,
or from which a record has not yet been read, an error condition will be set but never detected.
</p>

<p>
To address these possible error conditions, add an <code>IF</code> statement to test
the file status field, as in the following example.
</p>

<sample src="IgnoringFileStatusAfterRewriteGood.CBL" />

</example>
